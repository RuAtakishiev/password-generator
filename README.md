password-generator
==================

This is a simple console password generator with minimal settings: the use of numbers, uppercase and lowercase letters, as well as special characters.

> :warning: **If you cannot enter the required password length**: Depending on the number of character categories used, the minimum character length changes. That is, if you use only numbers and special characters, then the minimum password length is two, if you decide to add uppercase letters to this set of characters, then the minimum password length will already be 3. This is done in order to use all the characters in the password that the user has defined.
