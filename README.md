>:dizzy: As you can see, the page has several types of display. It depends on the screen resolution of your device. I tried to make the page as responsive as possible.
If you have any ideas on how to make the page more responsive or beautiful, please send your idea to my email address <atakishiev32ruslan@gmail.com>.
